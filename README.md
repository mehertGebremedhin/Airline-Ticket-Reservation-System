Project examples for an airline ticket reservation system using Java for the backend and React.js for the frontend, incorporating design patterns. Additionally, I've included descriptions of some notable projects.

Simple Project: Airline Ticket Reservation System
Backend (Java):
I use the Singleton pattern for the Reservation System to ensure that there's only one instance managing the tickets.
Frontend (React.js):
I use the Container-Presenter pattern to separate the logic and UI components.
